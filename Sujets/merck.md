Description of the Project
--------------------------

### Background ###

Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for vision
loss. IOP can be reduced via topical medications (such as prostaglandin
analogues, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and beta blockers) that modulate the
production and/or the drainage of aqueous humor. The response to IOP-lowering
medications is not consistent among individuals. Many factors have been
hypothesized to influence the drug efficacy, including the levels of IOP and
blood pressure and the co-presence of anti-hypertensive medications. These
factors are very difficult to isolate in vivo and therefore this project aims
at addressing this problem by combining mathematical modeling and clinical
data.

### Methods ###

Unidentified clinical data on over 100 glaucoma patients treated with
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, prostaglandins, beta-blockers, alpha agonists,
and combination treatments will be made available by Dr. Harris’s
team. Students will develop mathematical models describing the production and
drainage of the aqueous humor that determine the IOP level. Aqueous humor is
obtained by filtration of blood and this process is strongly influenced by the
level of systemic blood pressure. Additionally, the action of IOP on ocular
blood vessels can lead to vessel compression and, in extreme cases, to venous
collapse, thereby compromising the dynamics of aqueous humor.

Students will start the mathematical modeling with a simplified lumped
compartment approach, exploiting the analogy between the flow of a fluid and
the flow of a current. The effect of IOP-lowering drug medications will be
incorporated by allowing the filtration constants to depend on the specific
drug action. This simplified approach will lead to a system of nonlinear
ordinary differential equations that can be solved using MATLAB and can
provide invaluable insights in the mechanisms governing the regulation of IOP.

### Outcomes ###


The main challenge in this project lies in the set up of a physiologically
reasonable mathematical model that can capture the main interplay between
production/drainage of aqueous humor, systemic blood pressure and IOP. The
mathematical models will provide a virtual laboratory framework in which the
contribution of systemic and ocular factors can be isolated and their
influence on the determination of IOP level can be assessed independently. By
comparing the model predictions with clinical data, understanding will be
gained on the mechanisms modulating IOP levels in different individuals and
will be made available to the sponsoring companies.
